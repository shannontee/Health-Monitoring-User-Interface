# Health Monitoring System: User Interface
A Healthcare Monitoring System was developed that connected various healthcare devices (fitness watch, smart scale, sleep tracker) and aggregated the data into one comprehensive view. The data from the devices was stored, accessed, and modified through a Firebase Cloud database. A User Interface was created using Django to display data and control the three healthcare devices.
