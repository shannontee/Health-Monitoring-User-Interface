# Health Monitoring System: User Interface
A Healthcare Monitoring System was developed that connected various healthcare devices (fitness watch, smart scale, sleep tracker) and aggregated the data into one comprehensive view. The data from the devices was stored, accessed, and modified through a Firebase Cloud database. A User Interface was created using Django to display the data and control the three healthcare devices. In addition to providing statistics and graphs of each device's data, it allowed the user to input data to Firebase as well as show and control the current state of the device directly in the user interface. More details and images of the system can be found in the write up.
